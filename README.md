  A BattleTech mixed system designed to smoothly integrate Total Warfare, MechWarrior: Destiny, several other BattleTech products, and the work of the lovely people at BattleTech: Destiny. The intended experience is more akin to what is found in a MechWarrior game- a lance of mercenaries struggling to make it through another month.

  While sort of in flux and uncertain with its exact goals right now, the primary objective is to create a system that functions as something of a scavenging, survival-type of BattleTech campaign. Many other projects like BattleTech: Destiny blend the RPG with BattleTech's usual scale very successfully and the niche those fill isn't intended for this project. Primarily, the end result should be an RPG system that heavily encourages salvage, struggling, and small forces of player characters no larger than a lance or two of 'Mechs- or other vehicles, if you so choose.
